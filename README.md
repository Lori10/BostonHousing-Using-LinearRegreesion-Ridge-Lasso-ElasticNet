# BostonHousing-Using-LinearRegreesion-Ridge-Lasso-ElasticNet

In this repo I have implemented a machine learning project which predicts the house price in Boston. I have covered these topics : Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering including feature scaling, transformation into normally distributed data, multicollinearity, feature selection. I have trained the dataset using Linear Regression, Ridge , Lasso and Elastic Net Regression
